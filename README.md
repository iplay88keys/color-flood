# Color Flood

A react redux implementation of color flood.

React/Redux is not the ideal framework for web games.
This project was for practicing building a React/Redux app from "scratch" ([create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app))
and the game seemed to be small enough in scope for that use case.
